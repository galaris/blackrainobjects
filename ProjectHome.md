BlackRainObjects is derived from the Spectre Framework for World of Warcraft, and handles Object Management for many aspects of the game, including:

  1. Items
  1. Players
  1. NPCs
  1. Containers
  1. Corpses
  1. Game Objects
  1. Dynamic Objects

The object reading is done through BlackMagic by Shynd, and the framework uses descriptors as its source of information.

BlackRain provides a clean, and easy to use API to retrieve information from the objects easily.

**BlackRain currently supports World of Warcraft version 4.0.6.**

Version 1.2 and later also provides a complete XML documentation for use in Visual Studio, with all public members of the library properly documented.
